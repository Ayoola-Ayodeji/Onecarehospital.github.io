**Project Description**

Care one hospital is a mid-size (approximately 350 bed) teaching hospital connected with a medical school at a major university. It has been a recognized leader in providing quality care and recently achieved magnet status. Care One Hospital is a not-for-profit county hospital providing care to anyone in need regardless of their ability to pay. They have an emergency room connected with their hospital, several floors for general inpatient care, and several specialty care departments.

The administrators at Care One hospital have recently become concerned about the uptick in patients’ length of stay at their hospital. After investigating this problem, several providers at Care One Hospital have noted that the time taken to receive an ordered X-Ray is excessively long. Care One Hospital has pulled five months of data from 2016 to 2017. The data has been de-identified, so a unique identification number has been assigned to patients, providers, and radiology technicians.

**GOAL OF THE TASK**

To help Care One Hospital reduce the uptick in patients’ length of stay at their hospital by making meaningful recommendatons.
